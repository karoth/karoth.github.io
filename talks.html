         <p itemprop="description"> Mathemalchemy is a room sized art installation that represents math through beautyand whimsy. It is currently on view at The University of Quebec in Montreal and will
hopefully make a European tour starting in Fall 2027. What is Mathemalchemy? How
did it come about? How did Dr. Roth get involved? Where has it been and where is
going? I will answer these questions and lead a conversation about how math and art
combine in the work.</p>

            <p itemprop="description"> Corequisite courses have increasingly become common in mathematics, especially at the college algebra level. To help students be successful in MA 130 Calculus 1, we added a 5th hour of calculus lab to the 4-credit course and administered a Precalculus assessment early enough that students can switch to Precalculus. Students prepare for the 5th hour by watching videos to work through prerequisite topics and then work in groups on problems that use the prerequisite topics in the context of Calculus. We share details of the implementation and reflect on its success in the first semester. </p>

            <p itemprop="description">Mathemalchemy brought together twenty-four mathematical artists and artistic mathematicians to create a large multimedia mathematical art installation, celebrating the creativity and beauty of mathematics. The project, which began in 2019 under the leadership of mathematician Ingrid Daubechies and fiber artist Dominique Ehrmann, debuted this year for its tour of exhibitions. In this talk, we will take a virtual tour of the installation, highlighting some specific vignettes, their mathematical connections, and their fabrication process. We will also discuss plans for related outreach programs, including workshops for K12 students. </p>

            <p itemprop="description">With Loren Rhodes. Abstract: Introduction to Data Science is often offered as a course with prerequisites varying from an introductory statistics course to a first course in programming. Juniata College offers Introduction to Data Science as a class with no prerequisites that is intended for first year students. The course is part of the minor in Data Science. It is team taught by a statistician and a computer scientist and uses R and Weka as computing tools. This poster will talk about the course and its content along with successes and challenges in offering the course.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Abstract:This semester all three of my classes, Introduction to Probability and Statistics, Introduction to Data Science, and Statistical Consulting are using R. Each class has many students who have never used R and have a few who have. I will discuss the implementations that I used in each class and what the advantages and challenges of each implementation were. Options such as using an R Studio server and different graphing tools will be discussed.</p>

            <p><span class="material-symbols-outlined">schedule</span> January 25, 2017</p>
            <p itemprop="description"><strong>Talk, Brown Bag SoTL Talk Series, Juniata College, Huntingdon, PA</strong></p>
            <p itemprop="description">Joint work and talk with Henry Escuadro. Abstract: When teaching a course with a prerequisite, we sometimes find that many students are underprepared on the prerequisite material needed. Whether we do a formal review or not is dependent on many factors. But if we are going to review the prerequisite material for the course we are teaching, two relevant questions that we should ask are how and when. In AY 2016, Henry Escuadro and Kim Roth worked on a project that they hoped would answer these questions in the context of Calculus 1. The standard prerequisite for Calculus 1 is Precalculus. Though Precalculus is offered at Juniata, many students taking Calculus 1 encounter the prerequisite materials in high school. However, due to various reasons, we find that many students come underprepared on precalculus material and doing a review of precalculus benefits a group of these students. Members of the Math Department do reviews two different ways — the first method is done at the beginning of the semester while the second method is done throughout the semester. This project was done to determine whether there was a difference in effectiveness between the two methods.</p>

            <p itemprop="description"><strong>Talk, Joint Mathematics Meetings, Seattle, WA</strong></p>
            <p itemprop="description">Abstract: Classroom response systems or clickers are a popular way to get whole class feedback on a question. Used with peer instruction and discussion they can enhance students understanding of the material. However many systems cost both you and the students money. Plickers is a new free option for which the students use no devices to answer the question. Instead it uses pictures based on QR codes. I will discuss the reasons clicker questions are great to use in the introductory statistics classroom and the successes and challenges of doing so with Plickers.</p>
